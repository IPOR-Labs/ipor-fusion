/**
 * @title Fuses Library - Core Component for Plasma Vault's Fuse Management System
 * @notice Library managing the lifecycle and configuration of fuses - specialized contracts that enable
 * the Plasma Vault to interact with external DeFi protocols
 * @dev This library is a critical component that:
 * 1. Manages the addition and removal of fuses to the vault system
 * 2. Handles balance fuse associations with specific markets
 * 3. Provides validation and access functions for fuse operations
 * 4. Maintains the integrity of fuse-market relationships
 *
 * Key Components:
 * - Fuse Management: Adding/removing supported fuses
 * - Balance Fuse Control: Market-specific balance tracking
 * - Validation Functions: Fuse support verification
 * - Storage Integration: Uses FuseStorageLib for persistent storage
 *
 * Integration Points:
 * - Used by PlasmaVault.execute() to validate fuse operations
 * - Used by PlasmaVaultGovernance.sol for fuse configuration
 * - Interacts with FuseStorageLib for storage management
 * - Coordinates with PlasmaVaultStorageLib for market data
 *
 * Security Considerations:
 * - Enforces strict validation of fuse addresses
 * - Prevents duplicate fuse registrations
 * - Ensures proper market-fuse relationships
 * - Manages balance fuse removal conditions
 * - Critical for vault's protocol integration security
